## Technologies Used

*   **React:**  A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **CSS:**  Used for styling the application.  Component-specific prefixes are used for class names to ensure maintainability.

## How to Use

1.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Open the app in your browser:** The app will typically open automatically at `http://localhost:3000`.

3.  **Add a transaction:** Fill in the description, amount, and type (income or expense) fields in the "Add Transaction" form and click the "Add" button.

4.  **View transactions:** The list of transactions will be updated to include the new transaction.

7.  **Check your balance:** The current balance is displayed prominently at the bottom of the app.

## Styling

The app uses plain CSS with a component-based approach. Each component has its own CSS file, and class names are prefixed with the component name to prevent style collisions and improve maintainability.
